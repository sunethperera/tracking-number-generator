Steps to setup, run and test the tracking number generator API

1. clone the project to the local environment where there is java support(I have used JDK version 21 here).
2. open the project through a preferred IDE that support java(I used Intellij idea tool for this)
3. Run the project from the IDE and test the application through either browser or a separate API tool such as postman.

Sample request -> localhost:8080/next-tracking-number?origin_country_id=MY&destination_country_id=SL&weight=1.234&created_at=2018-11-20T19:28:32%2B08:00&customer_id=de619854-b59b-425e-9db4-943979e1bd49&customer_name=RedBox Logistics&customer_slug=redbox-logistics

prerequisites -> Java (JDK version 21), Maven, git and a preferred IDE.
